### Test task for the Crown Castle team. (TS, Playwright)

A compact guide to run and explain this repo.

CI: GitHub Actions — ready-to-use pipelines for tests (all/checkers/cards). See runs: https://github.com/Qoopi/crown_castle_test_task/actions

## Tech stack

- **Playwright** (latest) — UI + API testing
- **TypeScript** (strict, `noImplicitAny: true`)
- **Node.js LTS** (18.x or 20.x)
- **ESLint + Prettier** — style & static checks
- **Reports**: Playwright HTML + JUnit XML (paths configured in `playwright.config.ts`)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS (18.x or 20.x)
- npm (bundled with Node.js) or nvm for managing Node versions (optional)
- Git
- macOS, Linux, or Windows (WSL2 recommended on Windows, optional)
- Internet access to download Playwright browsers during setup (no manual browser install needed)
